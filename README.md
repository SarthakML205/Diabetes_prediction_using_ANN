# Pima Diabetes Prediction with PyTorch Neural Network
Welcome to our Pima Diabetes Prediction project! In this project we're utilizing the power of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) implemented with PyTorch to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on health related factors.

So what's the deal, with this project? Well diabetes is a health concern and early detection can be crucial. Our goal is to develop a computer program that can analyze factors such as glucose levels, BMI, age and more to determine if someone may have diabetes or not.

Guess what? PyTorch plays a role here! PyTorch is a library that allows us to build learning models. It's like the ingredient, behind our Artificial Neural Network.
